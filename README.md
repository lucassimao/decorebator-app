# Decorebator App

A contextually based memorization app for expanding your vocabulary

## Goal

Help language learners acquire new expressions, idioms and vocabularies through a context focused way.

I'm personally tired of boring memorization apps, which throw words and expressions at me without any context nor paying attention on our personal goals and focus.

So I decided to build mine.
